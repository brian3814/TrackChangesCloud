# TrackChangesCloud

A C# .NET Revit add-in to track Revit BIM database modification history by creating, comparing and archiving element property snapshots in the cloud.

This project is a continuation and enhancement of the initial non-cloud-based external command Revit
add-in [TrackChanges](https://github.com/jeremytammik/TrackChanges).

For more information, please refer
to [The Building Coder](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com) and
the detailed article about the initial TrackChanges implementation
for [tracking element modification](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/tracking-element-modification.html).


## Enhancement &ndash; Automatic Snapshots and Cloud Storage

Cf. [FireRatingCloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud) for in-depth discussions on the cloud storage aspects.
